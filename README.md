The Embedded Systems Knowledgebase is a concise, organized record of notes regarding all topics related to embedded systems engineering. The goal is to have a quick reference manual available for engineers as a reminder of some of the basics as well as the nuances of the various tools and techniques at our disposal. If anyone would like to begin contributing please contact me at RobertAMoore@ramembeddedtech.com.

The knowledgebase is hosted at ramembeddedtech.com which is a WordPress website. An account may be neccessary to contribute to the knowledgebase.

This GitHub repository serves as an issue tracker for the knowledgebase. Issues can be related to bugs, broken links, misinformation, typos, etc.

RULES:

1. Posts should be VERY specific in their topic. Prior to publishing, consider if the topic can be split into multiple smaller posts. When a topic results in numerous posts it maybe time to create its own direcory/subdirectory. 

2. Posts should BRIEFLY explain the topic at hand. When, where, and why it is useful. And, if relevant, provide a simple code example using the "Code  Mirror" plugin. When an equation is necessary use the "KaTex" plugin.

3. Each post should strive to provide links at the bottom of the page to more thorough resources under a header (H3) entitled "Additional Resources". These resources may include non-linkable sources such as textbooks. In this case you should provide a link to the book on amazon and rename the link after the title of the book.

4. BEFORE publishing a post. In the sidebar under the tab labeled "Knowledge Base Article" locate the drop-down menu labeled "Section" and choose the appropriate directory to publish the post under.

5. The structure of the knowledgebase (i.e. directories and subdirectories) should not be modified without first raising an issue on GitHub and receiving approval.

6. Do not modify existing post that you did not write without first raising an issue on GitHub

7. After creating a post regarding a topic from the "Contents to Add" section (found in the Knowledgebase under "Useful Resources" -> "Contributing to the Knowledgebase") , please remove it from the list.
